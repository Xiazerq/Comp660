			<h1>Ethics and Discoveries in the Sciences</h1>
			<h2>By: Joshua Quattrone</h2>
			<p>
				Often times it is said when scientists make a major discovery that is counter to popular beliefs, the saying “Why does science ways try to disprove god?” Well the honest reply to that is that scientists are not actively trying, and for most that is not the intent of their research. While not all scientific discoveries are valid, the scientific process, when used correctly, is a thoroughly vetted process that has netted many results. The question that should be asked instead is, “Why does science always try to disprove science?!” The answer to this is much simpler, “because scientists are always skeptical.” When a new theory is presented, there will always be a chorus of opposition, whether it be loud or quiet. In the case of one Percival Lowell, he had made discoveries that were soon found to be false.

			<p>
			It was believed in the late 1800s and early 1900s that there was an abundance of water bearing canals present on the planet Mars.Percival Lowell was a strong supporter and was responsible in popularizing the concept in the public. He had published several books on the subject along with several sketches that he had drawn himself. The concept itself was responsible for many early beliefs that life did exist on Mars, ultimately leading to many works in fiction.

			 Due to Lowell’s wealth, he was able to found the Lowell Observatory and dedicate much of his life to the science of astronomy. Utilizing one of the most powerful telescopes at the time, his viewings were highly regarded in the community. However, there controversy surrounded much of his research into the Martian canals. Many scientists around the world, with similarly sized telescopes could not replicate the findings of Lowell, and it wasn’t until the mid-1960s when NASA set a satellite into orbit around Mars and observers received the highest resolution photos of mars, that the concept was thoroughly discredited. It was discovered that the canals that Lowell had convinced himself he was seeing, was actually a reflection of the veins inside is viewing eye, which is why some scientists could see them, but could never replicate them to match Lowell’s discovery.
			</p>
			<p>
			Lowell was convinced of his work even in the face of overwhelming opposition, he used his position at the Lowell Observatory to enforce his findings. He would regularly rebuff those who presented data that was counter to his, then continue to publish other findings that supported his ideas. This misinformation was only furthered by the fact that the public perception of these canals, and the possibility of alien life fascinated the public and news outlets at the time would continually circulate it to sell newspapers. The implications of this are a classic example of how ego can affect scientific data and potentially set back aspects of the field. One fortunate aspect of this miscalculation is that it only lead to heated arguments and not in the deaths of anyone involved.

			While the canals of Mars were a misstep for Lowell, he had a long career as an astronomer and was able to advance the sciences. Additionally, he was instrumental in laying the groundwork for the discovery of the dwarf planet Pluto, which was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory.
